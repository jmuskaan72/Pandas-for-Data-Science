# pandas

This code sample is a walkthrough to cover the fundamental concepts to use for Python Pandas used in Data Science.

Here, we then look at different ways I tried to perform on Pokemon Dataset: 
* Loading the data into Pandas (CSVs, Excel, TXTs, etc.)
* Reading Data (Getting Rows, Columns, Cells, Headers, etc.)
* Iterate through each Row
* Getting rows based on a specific condition
* High Level description of your data (min, max, mean, std dev, etc.)
* Sorting Values (Alphabetically, Numerically)
* Making Changes to the DataFrame
* Adding a column
* Deleting a column
* Summing Multiple Columns to Create new Column.
* Rearranging columns
* Saving our Data (CSV, Excel, TXT, etc.)
* Filtering Data (based on multiple conditions)
* Reset Index
* Regex Filtering (filter based on textual patterns)
* Conditional Changes
* Aggregate Statistics using Groupby (Sum, Mean, Counting)
* Working with large amounts of data (setting chunksize)
